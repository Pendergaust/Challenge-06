# Challenge-06
A weather dashboard was created to present the user with today's current weather as well as a five day forecast. Searches are stored in local storage and populate as buttons that can be clicked.

Icons are presented to show weather (for example sun icon for sunny weather, cloud icon for cloudy weather). Different colours represent severity of UV index. 

The dashboard uses bootstrap for the layout (albeit it needs works), jQuery, and momentJS.
